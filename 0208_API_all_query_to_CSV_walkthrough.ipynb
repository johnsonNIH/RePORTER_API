The available request parameters are listed in the RePorter API documentation (https://api.reporter.nih.gov/?urls.primaryName=V2.0).

If there are 1000 records in total, to retrieve record #501, the \"offset\" parameter must be set to 500. To retrieve all matching records, multiple requests must be made, incrementing the offset value each time. This process is performed in a loop in the script, and is demonstrated in the following code blocks."

    "This tutorial has demonstrated how to effectively retrieve all records that match specified criteria through the RePorter API. We have shown two different methods of accomplishing this: using a for loop with a known number of iterations, or using a more flexible and fail-safe while loop. The returns of each iteration in this tutorial are saved in separate lists, while other approaches are available. With the ability to specify criteria such as agency, fiscal year, award type, PI names and more, users can easily extract the data they need from the API and analyze it in a manner that suits their needs."
